# Will You Be My Valentine

## Project Overview
This project is simple fun project designed to ask someone to be your valentine. Actually, I was asked by a friend to make this.
For short, it may play a song through the website, the YES button will get bigger as the user presses NO and it will send me an email when the user clicks on YES. It looks cute and charming.
